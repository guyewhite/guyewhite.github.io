  I am G. Elvin White. I help musicians learn code and programmers learn music. Call me "G". 🦾

I teach in at a well-known university in a well-known computer science course. In addition, I study music at Berklee College of Music Online ("Berklee Online"). My primary aspiration is to help programmers learn how to engage with music and exercise their creative muscles that are aching to be heard and be known! Further, I am an expert at helping musicians step into the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.
