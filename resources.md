We stand on the shoulders of giants! The following resources have been exceptionally helpful to me in my learning. I hope you will find these useful too! Many of the books listed below are no longer in print. So sad! When out of print, you can find many of these resources by keeping a watchful eye on your favorite online used goods seller.
